The NXP MCUXpresso Software Development Kit (MCUX) provides device header files
and peripheral drivers for Kinetis, LPC, and i.MX SoCs.

It was previously called the Kinetis Software Development Kit (KSDK), then
renamed to include support for LPC and i.MX SoCs.

The K64F sources in this directory are imported from mcux.nxp.com.

MCUX for KWxx is not yet deployed on mcux.nxp.com like most other devices,
therefore the sources are imported from the KW41Z product page on nxp.com:
