NXP FRDM-KW41Z
##############

Overview
********

The FRDM-KW41Z is a development kit enabled by the Kinetis® W series
KW41Z/31Z/21Z (KW41Z) family built on ARM® Cortex®-M0+ processor with
integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth® Smart/Bluetooth®Low Energy
(BLE) v4.2, Generic FSK, IEEE® 802.15.4 and Thread.

The FRDM-KW41Z kit contains two Freedom boards that can be used as a
development board or a shield to connect to a host processor. The FRDM-KW41Z is
form-factor compatible with the Arduino™ R3 pin layout for more expansion
options.

The FRDM-KW41Z highly-sensitive, optimized 2.4 GHz radio features a PCB
F-antenna which can be bypassed to test via SMA connection, multiple power
supply options, push/capacitive touch buttons, switches, LEDs and integrated
sensors.

System Clock
============

The KW41Z SoC is configured to use the 32 MHz external oscillator on the board
with the on-chip FLL to generate a 40 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The KW41Z SoC has one UART, which is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The FRDM-KW41Z includes an `OpenSDA`_ serial and debug adaptor built into the
board. The adaptor provides:

- A USB connection to the host computer, which exposes a Mass Storage and an
  USB Serial Port.
- A Serial Flash device, which implements the USB flash disk file storage.
- A physical UART connection which is relayed over interface USB Serial port.

Flashing an application to FRDM-KW41Z
-------------------------------------

The sample application :ref:`hello_world` is used for this example.
Build the Zephyr kernel and application:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd $ZEPHYR_BASE
   $ . zephyr-env.sh
   $ cd $ZEPHYR_BASE/samples/hello_world/
   $ make BOARD=frdm_kw41z

Connect the FRDM-KW41Z to your host computer using the USB port and you should
see a USB connection which exposes a Mass Storage (DAPLINK) and a USB Serial
Port. Copy the generated zephyr.bin in the DAPLINK drive.

Reset the board and you should be able to see on the corresponding Serial Port
the following message:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm
